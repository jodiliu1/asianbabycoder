        Three.js is the main tool for achieving a 3d webpage, this page is also built based 
        on Vite app and Vanilla Js, in the coming weeks I will focus on practicing on three js 
        and compelte the solar system(as much as I can), adding materials to the sephere to make 
        the planets more realistic .<br>

        <br>This page is made for people who are obssesed with space :), willing to learn 
        knowledge about space and explore an immersive experience in the brower.
        There will be no gender limit at all for audience of this web page, age: from 12;
        <br>If you grow up watching startrek, 
        <br>If you are a housewife,
        <br>If you are 80 years old, bored from retirement life,
        <br>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> all welcomed

        <p>Mars missions have been launching from Earth with regularity since the 1960s, bent on exploring our planetary neighbor. With its potential for liquid water â€” and therefore, life â€” Mars is an alluring target. 

          But it's a difficult journey, and only about half of all Mars missions successfully make it to the Red Planet, according to NASA. A "Great Galactic Ghoul" must be consuming them, joked a journalist and a NASA scientist corresponding in 1964, reported the Economist.
          
          Since the first successful flyby in 1965, several space agencies have successfully made it to Mars. NASA, the former Soviet Union space program, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Indian Space Research Organization each met with earlier successes.  </p>
